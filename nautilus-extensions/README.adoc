= foodogsquared's custom nautilus-python extensions
:toc:

A personal set of https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus-python[nautilus-python] extensions.
You can either install it through https://mesonbuild.com/[Meson build system] or just test your luck by directly installing them at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nautilus-python/extensions` (you'll have to keep in mind some of the extensions might need them third-party Python modules though).
